Some examples on the web: [[https://quizlet.com/subject/easy-chinese-daily-routine-mandarin/][Daily Routine]]

[fn:1] The noun for shower is línyù/淋浴 - but it is not used as a verb.  línyù huài le / The shower is broken (huài opposite of hǎo, bad)
[fn:2] zài is used to change "I read" to "I am reading".  It does not specify the tense tho.  So "I was reading" is the same.
